## Practical Week 2
### Purpose of the Joomla website and its S.M.A.R.T goals

My Joomla website is designed for a Board Game Shop. Welcome all the Board Game players to purchase their favorite Board Players.
I hope this website is able to attract the current board game players and discover some of the potential players. 
Here is the S.M.A.R.T for my website.

* **Specific:** Develop an appealing and informative website that showcases a wide range of board games, provides clear contact information, and offers a user-friendly interface for customers to easily reach out.

* **Measurable:** Set measurable goals to track increased engagement and customer contact:
  * Increase the number of inquiries or contact form submissions from customers by 50% within six months after the website launch.
  * Aim to receive positive feedback or testimonials from at least 20% of customers who have used the contact information to inquire about board games within the first year.

* **Achievable:** Ensure that the goals are realistic and attainable within the context of your board game shop:
  * Implement effective marketing strategies, such as social media campaigns and email newsletters, to attract more visitors to the website.
  * Provide prompt and helpful customer service to inquiries to encourage customers to engage and make purchases.

* **Relevant:** Align the website's design and content to motivate customers to take action and make purchases:
  * Create enticing product descriptions, accompanied by high-quality images, to prompt customers to want more information or buy board games.

* **Time-bound:** Set a timeframe to achieve increased engagement and customer contact:
  * Aim to achieve the targeted increase in inquiries within six months from the website launch date.
  * Regularly review website analytics to track customer engagement and adjust strategies if necessary to meet the set goals.



## Learning Journey for Week 2
### Learning Activities & Resources
For Week 2 practical, I did my self-study about how to use Joomla to build a website. Since the website is hosted online, I did some research about it. Finally, I decided to use AWS to host my website.
To learn how to use Joomla, I watched a tutorial on Youtube. After the tutor learning, I spent two hours designing my own website.
Why I choose AWS to host my website, not Infinityfree, because AWS is able to provide a high-speed connection, and it is under their algorithm protection.

### Estimated hours
I spent 3 days on this practical. The self-learning process does not work really well, it makes me need more time to look for the right material to learn and practice.
